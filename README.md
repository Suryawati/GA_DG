This simulation for optimization Distributed Generator (DG) placement using Genetic Algoritm (GA).

- main file is GA_DG_real.m open it then Run

- the data using IEEE 14 Bus and IEEE 30 Bus 
- IEEE14BusS.m, LF.m, LF_nonDG.m, loadflow_100.m was taken/modified from Power System Analysis by H SAADAT
- Linearfitnessrangking.m, roulettewheel.m, pindahsilang.m and was taken from Algoritma Genetika dalam Matlab by Suyanto 2005
